# TODOS

## ExpectedConditions deprecated

* Still available from  in `DotNetSeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers` nuget package
* OR create my own implementation? If it's deprecated whats the better way?

## Better output

* Could use better output for things like string match fails (should what was found instead etc.)
